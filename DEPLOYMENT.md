### 1. Environment Setup
- [ ] Production server provisioned (2+ CPU, 4GB+ RAM)
- [ ] Domain name configured with SSL
- [ ] Environment variables configured
- [ ] Database backup strategy implemented
- [ ] Monitoring tools configured

### 2. Security Configuration
- [ ] HTTPS enabled with valid SSL certificate
- [ ] Firewall rules configured
- [ ] API keys secured (not in code)
- [ ] CORS origins restricted to production domains
- [ ] Rate limiting implemented
- [ ] Input validation enabled

### 3. Performance Optimization
- [ ] Database indexes created
- [ ] Redis caching configured
- [ ] CDN setup for static assets
- [ ] Image optimization enabled
- [ ] Bundle size optimized

### 4. API Keys and Services
- [ ] Production Clerk application configured
- [ ] OpenAI API key with sufficient credits
- [ ] SerpAPI key for contact discovery
- [ ] SendGrid API key for email delivery
- [ ] Cloud storage credentials (if using)

## ðŸ”§ Deployment Options

### Option 1: Docker Compose (Simple)
```bash
# 1. Clone repository on server
git clone your-repo
cd jobassist-ai

# 2. Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with production values

# 3. Start services
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d

# 4. Setup reverse proxy (Nginx)
# Configure SSL and domain routing
```

### Option 2: Kubernetes (Scalable)
```bash
# 1. Apply Kubernetes manifests
kubectl apply -f infrastructure/k8s/

# 2. Configure secrets
kubectl create secret generic jobassist-secrets \
  --from-env-file=.env \
  --namespace=jobassist-ai

# 3. Monitor deployment
kubectl get pods -n jobassist-ai
kubectl get services -n jobassist-ai
```

### Option 3: Cloud Platform (Managed)
- **Vercel**: For frontend deployment
- **Railway**: For full-stack deployment
- **Render**: For containerized deployment
- **AWS/GCP/Azure**: For enterprise deployment

## ðŸ“Š Monitoring Setup

### Application Monitoring
```bash
# Health check endpoint
curl https://your-domain.com/health

# Metrics endpoint
curl https://your-domain.com/metrics

# Database health
docker exec postgres pg_isready
```

### Log Aggregation
- **Backend logs**: JSON formatted with structured logging
- **Frontend logs**: Error tracking with Sentry
- **Database logs**: Query performance monitoring
- **Access logs**: Nginx/Load balancer logs

### Alerting Rules
- API response time > 5 seconds
- Error rate > 1%
- Database connection failures
- High memory/CPU usage
- Disk space < 10% free

## ðŸ”„ CI/CD Pipeline

### GitHub Actions Workflow
```yaml
# Triggers on main branch push
- Build and test application
- Run security scans
- Build Docker images
- Deploy to staging
- Run integration tests
- Deploy to production (manual approval)
```

### Deployment Strategy
- **Blue-Green**: Zero downtime deployments
- **Rolling Updates**: Gradual rollout
- **Feature Flags**: Controlled feature releases
- **Rollback Plan**: Quick revert capability

## ðŸ“ˆ Scaling Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling
- **Load Balancer**: Distribute traffic across instances
- **Database Replicas**: Read replicas for performance
- **Cache Layer**: Redis cluster for high availability
- **CDN**: Global content delivery

### Performance Tuning
- **Database Connection Pooling**: Optimize connections
- **Vector DB Optimization**: Tune Weaviate settings
- **API Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse
- **Background Jobs**: Async processing

## ðŸ”’ Security Hardening

### Infrastructure Security
- **Firewall**: Only necessary ports open
- **VPN**: Secure admin access
- **Backup Encryption**: Encrypted data backups
- **Access Control**: Principle of least privilege

### Application Security
- **Input Sanitization**: SQL injection prevention
- **XSS Protection**: Content Security Policy
- **CSRF Protection**: Token validation
- **API Authentication**: JWT token validation
